# console

The business client's view of lights-out ([ADR 0047](../docs/adr/0047-console-reads-one-versioned-logbook-and-writes-only-go-for-launch.md), [ADR 0055](../docs/adr/0055-the-dev-phase-visible-from-request-to-release.md); every field, rule and route in [docs/plans/console.md](../docs/plans/console.md)). Ten screens:

1. **Overview**: first, **Waiting for you**: every ticket whose turn is a person's, with the one thing to do; then **who runs each role** ([ADR 0086](../docs/adr/0086-the-role-matrix.md)): one row per role of `roles/` with its provider and model, its harness, its thinking level, the tokens of its run in flight or its last run against its `TOKEN_BUDGET` (a meter), and its state, under one sentence that counts the providers; then the tickets by state under the four bands of the flow; the delivery measures, in `./go dora`'s words, over the window ending at the record's last event ([ADR 0082](../docs/adr/0082-delivery-measures-from-the-logbook.md)); the spend per ticket, role and day with the budget, in `./go spend`'s words ([ADR 0083](../docs/adr/0083-cost-and-time-per-ticket-with-a-budget.md)), with the burn per hour of the last day that had a run, a sparkline of its 24 hours, the day's projection at that rate against `SPEND_BUDGET_DAY_USD` (marked when over) and the tickets whose attempt is in flight with their tokens against `TOKEN_BUDGET` ([ADR 0087](../docs/adr/0087-burn-projection-and-the-run-in-flight.md)); the perimeters `perimeters/held` names and whether each still holds; the tickets waiting at `assign` and on whom (ADR 0053); the docs tickets merges filed (ADR 0054).
2. **Kanban**: one list per tower state, under four bands of the flow (Spec, Build, Test and review, Release), a card per ticket in its state's list with its labels, its now line and its badges, ordered by priority then age, filtered and grouped by feature and priority (`- Feature:` and `- Priority:` in the ticket's header), with the empty columns shown or hidden; it takes the page's full width. Above the lists, one card per intake ([ADR 0090](../docs/adr/0090-the-intake-interview.md)): its id and state, the client's first words, how many questions were asked and answered, and the tickets it became; Enter or a click opens the intake's screen (see "The intake" below). See "The kanban" below.
3. **This week's tickets**: each with GO/NO-GO, the judge that decided, and its line.
4. **One ticket's timeline**: at the top, its now line with the one action, a strip of the four bands (done, now, or the one that stopped it), and the flow strip (see "The flow strip" below); below, one row per phase, grouped under those bands, each from its record: the request (who requested and through what), the product role's questions and the answers (who, through what, when), the spec gate's verdict, assign with the perimeter, each worker attempt with turns, tokens and duration, each gate line, review, rework, merge, the canary stages with their `slo:` numbers, the human answer, 100% or rollback. A ticket waiting on a question shows an answer box.
5. **Specs**: every ticket with its state, the confirmed criteria and who confirmed them, the last `spec` verdict with its line and time, and the open question with its answer box.
6. **New request**: first, **Describe the need**, a text area that starts an intake from a client's words (see "The intake" below); then an editor for a ticket's title, context, criteria (Given, When, Then), perimeter, feature and priority. It shows the ticket's Markdown as it would be written and, 300 ms after the last keystroke, the line of the spec gate itself. See "The request editor" below.
7. **ADRs and one ADR**: a search over the project map's ADRs (number, title, status, text, or a path an ADR cites). Each result shows its status, files, tickets and ADRs, each a link. A ticket's drawer lists the ADRs that govern its perimeter. The search needs a project map: `./go map` builds it at `MAP_FILE` (default `.crew/map.sqlite`). With none, the screen says so and names `./go map`.
8. **Incidents and post mortems**, with their fix tickets and those tickets' states.
9. **Go-for-launch**: the canary as it runs ([ADR 0080](../docs/adr/0080-the-live-canary.md)): each stage's traffic share, the canary's error rate and p95 latency against the stable and the threshold, when it started and was judged, the stage in course with the seconds left before its judgement, and an automatic rollback with its reason (also at the top of the overview while a release runs); then the ticket the release carries, the release record, what the plane runs now, the brief, and the buttons, which open the confirmation panel.
10. **Thresholds**: every number that can stop a change, where it is set, and its provenance ("undeclared" when it has none).

A switch in the header sets the theme: `system` (the default, it follows `prefers-color-scheme`), `light` or `dark`. The choice is kept in the browser's `localStorage` under `lights-out.theme`. A browser that refuses storage gets the system theme, and the switch works until the page closes. The theme changes colours only.

It reads **one document, the logbook** (`lights-out/logbook/1.7`, [schema](../core/logbook/1.7.schema.json)), which `./go logbook` writes. It never reads the tower, the plane or a file behind it. It has **five writes**: go-for-launch, through the same `core/promote.sh` and the same checks as `./go promote`; the answer to a ticket's or an intake's open question, through `make answer`, the recipe `./go answer` runs, accepted only for the question the logbook shows open; a new request, through `make request`, the recipe `./go request` runs; a client's need, through `make intake`; and the decisions on an intake's proposed tickets, through `make intake-confirm`. Each records who pressed and `via: console`. One more route, `/v1/spec-check`, writes nothing. `ci/logbook.sh` checks all of it. `GET /v1/logbook.json` carries an `ETag` and answers `304` to a matching `If-None-Match`, so the 2 s poll of an unchanged logbook costs no body.

## Whose turn it is

Every card, the card's back and the head of a ticket's timeline carry one line, its **now** ([ADR 0063](../docs/adr/0063-the-console-says-whose-turn-it-is.md)): who has the ball and what it waits for. When it is a person's turn the line says "Your turn" and links the one thing to do: answer the open question (the answer box on the timeline), go-for-launch when the ticket's canary is held and the release record is unanswered (the launch screen), or decide after the last rework attempt or after the spend budget stopped the next one (`needs-human`; a budget stop says the budget's line). A ticket a failed step stopped names `./go resume`. Every other state names who runs the step the tower requests next, from the tower's own table, which the page embeds (`<script id="tower-machine">`, as the board does) and `./go ci` proves equal to `core/tower.py`. The line is a reading of the record, never a verdict, and it moves no card.

## The kanban

A card's column is the logbook's `kanban`. Nothing on the page moves a card: a card changes column only when the tower moves its ticket. One card drags ([ADR 0079](../docs/adr/0079-the-human-gate-on-the-card.md)): the held release waiting for go-for-launch, onto **Promote to 100%** or **Rollback** above the board. The drop moves nothing: it opens the confirmation panel the launch screen's buttons open too, with the brief, the verify thresholds and their provenance, every stage's numbers, the risk and the PR's gate lines, and a reason, required for a rollback. Only its confirm button sends the press, the same `POST /v1/go-for-launch`. The two targets are buttons too: Tab to one and press Enter. The columns sit under four bands of the flow, in the logbook's order: **Spec** (`requested`, `questions`, `spec-ready`), **Build** (`opened`, `pr-opened`), **Test and review** (`review`, `ci-passed`, `ci-failed`, `needs-human`), **Release** (`merged`, `main-green`, `held`, `rolled-back`); any other state goes under **Other**. A column with no card in the view is drawn narrow, its state and count only, and the columns with cards share the width, so the whole board fits a 1440 px screen. Below 720 px the columns stack. What the page adds is a view:

- **The card's face** ([ADR 0068](../docs/adr/0068-the-kanban-that-is-looked-at.md)): the priority and the feature as coloured labels (a feature's colour comes from its name, so it is the same on every board), the title, the now line, and a row of badges: an icon for who has the ball (the product role, the spec gate, the dev-worker, the gates, the reviewer, the tower, the canary, you, or nobody when it is done or stopped), how long the ticket has been in its state (to the newest event in a snapshot, to the console's read time live; never your clock), its rework attempts as pips out of `REWORK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, its attempt in flight as tokens against `TOKEN_BUDGET` with a meter (marked `near` from 80%, ADR 0087), and the outcome. Under the now line, the flow strip in short. A card whose turn is yours has a bar on its edge.
- **The card's back**: click a card, or press Enter on it, and it turns over in a dialog above the dimmed board. It shows the now line with its one action as a button-like link (answer the question on the timeline, see the attempts, go-for-launch, or the `./go resume` command), the open question's text, the strip of the four bands, the flow strip with every node a tab stop, the attempt in flight's tokens, the timeline in a few lines, the state, the outcome verdict and line, the perimeter, the wait (ADR 0053), the ADRs that govern the perimeter and a link to the whole timeline. Esc, the Close button or a click outside it puts it back and returns the focus to the card. It has no answer box: the kanban writes nothing.
- **Your turn only**: a toggle that keeps only the cards whose turn is a person's.
- **Search**: by ticket id, title, or a path in a perimeter. A path matches a card when one of its globs matches it or contains it.
- **Keys**: the arrows move the focus between cards (left and right across columns, up and down inside one), Enter turns a card over, Esc puts it back, `/` focuses the search. The focus is always drawn.
- **Collapsible columns**: a collapsed column shows its state and count only.
- **The view is the link**: `#kanban?q=…&feature=…&priority=…&turn=you&group=…&empty=hide&collapsed=a,b&card=0005`. Defaults are left out and values are percent-encoded. A page opened on that hash draws the same board.
- **A moved card shows its move**: when a refresh puts a card in another column, it flies there from where it was (400 ms) and is drawn with a mark naming the column it left, highlighted for 4 s; a screen reader hears "0005 moved from opened to pr-opened". With `prefers-reduced-motion` nothing flies and the mark stays.
- **Long lists**: from 720 px up, a list taller than the window scrolls inside itself and keeps its header in view. Below 720 px the lists stack and a bar at the top jumps to each band.
- **Contrast**: every text on the board and on a card's back is at least WCAG 2.1 AA in both themes, and `ci/console-ui.py` measures it.

A refresh redraws only when the logbook changed, and keeps the focus, the drawer and the search box.

## The flow strip

Every ticket's path in one row ([ADR 0085](../docs/adr/0085-the-flow-strip.md)): the ticket (the request and the spec gate), the perimeter (assign, up to the PR), the eight gates in the order the tower runs them, the PR (the review when the risk asks for one, then the merge), the canary, the human gate and 100%. Each node is GO, NO-GO, running or not reached, with a mark that is not colour alone (✓, ✗, ◌, ·), the time it took from the record (each gate's own seconds, which the `gates` recipe now records) and its one-line reason. The logbook computes the nodes (`tickets[].flow`, logbook 1.6); the page draws them as they are.

- **On the card's face** the strip is a row of small segments, the reason in each one's tooltip. It is not a tab stop: the card is the board's keyboard unit, and the strip's accessible name reads every node and its verdict with the card.
- **On the card's back and the timeline** every node is a tab stop with its name, its time, and its reason shown on hover and on focus. A NO-GO gate with a why opens the why panel, by click or Enter.
- A logbook before 1.6 has no strip.

## The network

`#network` ([ADR 0071](../docs/adr/0071-the-governed-network-on-screen-and-in-text.md)) draws one ticket's agent network from the logbook alone: the tower at the centre, the six roles (lit when the record names them), the attempt's workers with their harness and model (a network attempt's members, at most four, ADR 0036), each gate lighting GO or NO-GO in the order it ran and the gates that did not run, the reviewer, the rework loop back to the dev-worker with its count, the canary stages and the one human gate before 100%. Beside it, every attempt, newest first, with the files it touched, the gate lines that judged it, verbatim, and its patch; a patch is shown only once that attempt's `secrets` gate said GO, and is cut at 64 KiB. A click, or Enter, on any red gate (the card's NO-GO chip, a rejected attempt's row on the back or the timeline, a NO-GO gate on `#network`) opens one panel with the why ([ADR 0078](../docs/adr/0078-the-why-of-a-no-go-one-click-away.md)): the gate's line, its details (withheld, like the patch, until that attempt's `secrets` said GO), the new SAST findings for a `sast` NO-GO, the attempt, the attempts left and the next move. Below, the files by perimeter: which glob holds each, which worker and attempts touched it, which tests cover it (the project map's `tests` edges), which ADRs cite it and which open ticket holds it.

- **The view is the link**: `#network/<ticket>?attempt=<n>`; with no ticket it follows the one updated last.
- **Live**: when the 2 s poll brings a logbook that adds facts to the ticket shown, they are marked for 4 s and said to a screen reader. A patch and its gate lines reach the logbook when the attempt's step ends: the stream is per attempt, not per keystroke.
- **Replay**: the Replay button (or `?replay=1`) reveals the record one timeline row every 2 s under a label that says it is a replay and that nothing is running. It sends no request until it ends.
- **The same facts in text**: `./go network TICKET=<id> [ATTEMPT=<n>]` prints every fact of the screen in the same words, from the same logbook. The words are one table, `core/network.py --table`, embedded in the page as `#network-words`; `./go ci` proves the copy equal.
- **An older logbook** (1.2) draws one worker per attempt and one summary gate edge, and says it records no patches or gate lines.

## The request editor

The spec gate's line and the Request button sit in a bar held at the bottom of the window, so the verdict is in view while you type. After a save that wrote the ticket, the form is emptied, Request waits for the next edit, and the top of the editor links the new ticket's timeline: a second press cannot file the same text twice.

`POST /v1/spec-check` takes the fields, has `core/spec.py draft` write the draft into a temporary directory, runs `gates/spec.sh` on it and answers `{ticket, markdown, line}`. The line is the gate's own: `GO: spec` or `NO-GO: spec — <why>`. Nothing is written in the repository or the tower. It is refused with `CONSOLE_AUTH=public`.

Save is the third write, `POST /v1/request`:

- It is refused in snapshot mode and with `CONSOLE_AUTH=public`. It checks the draft again and refuses a NO-GO draft with nothing written.
- On a GO draft it creates `TICKETS_DIR/<id>.md`, the next id after the highest four-digit id there, with an exclusive create (a second save at once gets 409). It then runs `make request TICKET=<id>` with `REQUEST_BY` set to the identity and `REQUEST_VIA=console`. The tower records both on the request, and the timeline's request row shows them.
- The file is written, not committed. The editor says so and names the file. Committing it is yours.
- At L0 the product role is not consulted on a new request: it replays recordings and a new request has none. The editor says so before saving, and the spec gate alone judges the request. At L1, with a key, saving is how the role is consulted; its questions open the ticket at `questions` and the answer box takes them.

## The intake

An intake starts from a client's words, before any ticket exists ([ADR 0090](../docs/adr/0090-the-intake-interview.md)). "Describe the need" on the request screen is the fourth write, `POST /v1/intake {text}`: refused in snapshot mode and with `CONSOLE_AUTH=public`, it runs `make intake` with the text as `INTAKE_FILE`, `INTAKE_BY` set to the identity and `INTAKE_VIA=console`. The words are written to `TICKETS_DIR/<id>.intake.md` under the next free id, uncommitted.

`#intake/<id>` shows the request, the product role's questions and the answers, with the answer box on the open one (the same `POST /v1/answer` as a ticket's); then the proposed tickets, each with its criteria, feature, priority, the perimeter the architect role proposed, the spec gate's line on it as a draft, and, once confirmed, its decision and the ticket it became. At `proposed`, each ticket has three choices, confirm, edit or drop, and "edit" opens its fields. The confirm button is the fifth write, `POST /v1/intake-confirm {intake, decisions}`: refused in snapshot mode, and unless the logbook shows that intake at `proposed` with as many tickets as decisions; it runs `make intake-confirm` with `DECISIONS`, `CONFIRM_BY` and `CONFIRM_VIA=console`. Each ticket kept is written under the next free id and starts at `spec-ready`, where the spec gate opens it or sends it back with its reason. An edited ticket is judged by the gate after the confirmation, not as it is typed.

At L0 an intake runs only where its interview was recorded; elsewhere the request is refused with one line that names how to record it, and the intake card shows where it stopped.

## Run it

```bash
./go up
```

```bash
./go console
```

Open http://localhost:8098. After `./go demo` it shows ticket 0001's timeline from `requested` to the rollback. At L0 the product role has no recording for that request, and its row says it was not consulted (ADR 0055 §3). To press the button, hold a canary first: `./go kill-switch`, then `./go release`, which holds the canary at 25% when verify passes (`git checkout app/flags/flags.json` undoes the kill switch afterwards). `CONSOLE_PORT` moves the port.

Without the plane, serve a logbook file instead; nothing can be pressed, answered or saved (the spec check still works):

```bash
CONSOLE_SNAPSHOT=console/snapshot/logbook.json ./go console
```

`./go demo-console` is the acceptance: a held canary promoted by an HTTP POST to a running console, checked at 100% through Envoy, then un-promoted. It is not part of `./go demo`.

## Who may press (`CONSOLE_AUTH`)

The console has no login, no session and no password. It does not start unless the mode is declared:

| `CONSOLE_AUTH` | When | Who presses |
|---|---|---|
| `loopback` (default) | published on 127.0.0.1, ::1 or localhost only | anyone at that machine; recorded as `unauthenticated` |
| `proxy` | behind a proxy that authenticates, with `CONSOLE_IDENTITY_HEADER` naming the header it sets | go-for-launch: the identities listed in `CONSOLE_LAUNCHERS` (comma-separated, compared verbatim). Answer and request: any identity the proxy sets. A request without the header gets 401 |
| `public` | only with `CONSOLE_SNAPSHOT=console/snapshot/logbook.json` | nobody: no write, and no spec check |

Every POST also needs `Content-Type: application/json`, an `Origin` and `Host` that are the console's own (`CONSOLE_HOSTS` adds host names a proxy uses). go-for-launch also needs a body that matches the record and the brief as they are now, and a non-blank `reason` for a NO-GO; the reason goes into the record and the release log with the brief's sha256 and author (ADR 0079 §1). Only one press runs at a time. `CONSOLE_LAUNCHERS` stays the go-for-launch list: it does not limit who may answer or request.

**`proxy` trusts a header.** The console cannot tell whether a request came through the proxy. Make it reachable from the proxy only (bind it to a private interface, a firewall rule, or the same pod), or anyone can claim any identity. Behind Google's Identity-Aware Proxy the header is `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` and its value carries the `accounts.google.com:` prefix, which `CONSOLE_LAUNCHERS` must repeat. The first version does not verify IAP's signed `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` (ADR 0047, provisional decision 8). oauth2-proxy's header names were not verified when this was written; check your proxy's documentation.

## What is real at L0

- **The record is real**: the tower's documents, the release log (`.crew/releases.jsonl`), launchpad's record and the policy files, as `./go logbook` reads them.
- **The tower is in memory at L0**: tickets from before the last `./go down` are not shown, and screen 1 says so. The mirror that fixes this (ADR 0031 §6) is not built yet.
- **The workers replayed**: at L0 a ticket's task shows the provider, model and tokens of the recorded run, marked "replayed"; no tokens were spent. The role matrix shows no provider at L0 (the profile names none) and the last run's provider and model from the recording.
- **The run in flight is L1's**: the replay harness keeps no token count, so at L0 no card shows an attempt in flight. From L1 a card shows it while the dev-worker runs, from the count the budget hooks keep in `.crew/<ticket>/out/tokens`.
- **The brief at L0 is rendered from the record** by `core/promote.sh`, labelled as such; from L1 the release role writes it (ADR 0020 §4).
- **The button is real**: it runs `core/promote.sh`, which shifts the canary to 100% or rolls it back.

## Who built it

This first version was written by a Claude Code session on 2026-11-04, by hand, as plain HTML and a standard-library Python server, without Stitch and without a frontend worker: no key could be spent where it was built, and Stitch's export format is still unverified (ADR 0047, provisional decision 6). The plan is for Stitch to design the five screens into `design/` and a frontend worker to rebuild `index.html` from it, against the same logbook and the same ci check.

The Trello-style kanban (ADR 0068, 2026-11-10) is hand-built the same way: Stitch's export format is still unverified, and a design in `design/` that no test reads would drift from the page. The alternative stays open: rebuild the page from a Stitch design, against the same tests.
