# gates-harness-conformance: every CLI harness's entry requirement (docs/adr/
# 0041 §8), written from the ADR and the adapter contract, never from an
# adapter. A CLI harness is an adapters/<name>/ with run.sh, Containerfile
# and a pin, package-lock.json or release.env (docs/adr/0050 §2):
# discovered, never listed. For each one, eleven cases
# in a fixed order, the first disagreement a NO-GO naming the harness and
# the case:
#   0 pairing      1 valid PR          2 push denied        3 secrets read denied
#   4 the workspace cannot switch the guard off            5 MAX_TURNS
#   6 TOKEN_BUDGET 7 TIMEOUT_S         9 confinement        10 agents
#   8 no key in artefacts
# Cases 9 and 10 run before case 8 because case 8 reads every case's
# artefacts, theirs included (docs/adr/0046, "Conformance").
#
# Case 10, agents (docs/adr/0073 "Tests"): what a repository's contract adds
# to a run, read at the case's BASE as core/crew.sh and core/steps/review.sh
# read it, through core/agents.py. 10a, every harness: a role file for the
# test-reviewer with a random marker; the first request holds the role
# prompt's first line, then the marker, then the restated output contract,
# and final.md's first line is APPROVED. Where adapters/<name>/mcp.sh exists
# (a harness honours mcp.json if and only if it has one, discovered): 10b,
# the fixture server ($WORKLOAD_CONTRACT/mcp/notes.py, declared by
# $WORKLOAD_CONTRACT/mcp.json with search_notes only) called by the
# dev-worker, its unnamed count_notes hidden or visible and denied as
# run.json's .mcp.unlisted says, its answer in the next request and
# count_notes's never; 10c, a server that exits at start fails the run in a
# line naming it and ADR 0073 §8. Where it does not: agents.py mcp refuses,
# in §8's line, and no container is started. The contract's directory name is
# the basename of WORKLOAD_CONTRACT, never written here (ci/app-free.sh).
#
# Confinement (docs/adr/0046): the harness is on an internal network and its
# one way out is the `egress` proxy, which opens the scripted model and nothing
# else. So in every case from 1 to 9 each request the stub logged came from
# egress's address, as seen from the stub's side (resolved by `docker-compose
# exec` inside the stub's container, so it is the address the stub's own
# network gives `egress`, whichever engine runs it), and no
# request reached `conformance-sink`, the stub's second name, or /exfil. Case 9
# runs gates/harness-conformance/probe.py inside the harness, which reads the
# key canary from its own environment and tries eight ways to send it out (the
# ADR's (a) to (h), listed in the probe). All eight must read `blocked` in the
# next request's tool result; the proxy's log, taken during the case, must hold
# a DENY for each proxied way and an ALLOW for conformance-model only.
#
# What it runs: the real pinned CLI in its real image, driven by `sh
# adapters/<name>/run.sh` exactly as core/crew.sh does; only the far end of
# the wire is scripted (gates/harness-conformance/stub.py, compose service
# conformance-model). So it proves a harness's plumbing, never a model's
# ability and never the vendors' real wire: only an L1 recording does that.
#
# The adapter contract, each key read from adapters/<name>/conformance.env
# (PROVIDER, MODEL, KEY_VAR, THINKING_PATH, EGRESS) and thinking.env, never from
# a list here. Every harness's KEY_VAR is exported with a random canary before
# compose starts, because compose falls back to the project's .env for a
# variable missing from the environment, and on the owner's machine that file
# holds a real key.
#
# Provenance of the numbers (docs/adr/0041 §8, each a decision, not a
# measurement): MAX_TURNS=2 is the smallest limit that lets a run make more
# than one request; TOKEN_BUDGET=2500 can only be crossed by accumulating
# three responses of 1,000 tokens; TIMEOUT_S=30 is self-checking, because case
# 7 also requires that the stub saw the request it never answered, so a value
# shorter than a CLI's start fails the case instead of passing it; the stub's
# script calls a tool on every request and ends at step 20, which turns a
# budget that does not bind into a visible ordinary end, not a hang; "at most
# 3 requests" is the limit plus one, because each CLI counts a turn its own
# way. The port is a decision of this gate: 8089, inside the compose network
# only. CONFORMANCE_TIMEOUT_S moves case 7's 30 and is set by
# gates/harness-conformance/proof.sh alone, which cannot wait 30 s a harness.
#
# Case 9's numbers (docs/adr/0046, "Conformance", each a decision): the way that
# names an allowed host on another port uses the stub's port + 1, 8090, a port it
# does not serve; the probe waits 5 s per way (a local listener answers in far
# less, and eight fit well under the role's TIMEOUT_S); 1.1.1.1 is a public
# anycast address and example.com the IANA documentation domain, so those two
# ways prove something only on a host with internet. The two numbers of this
# gate's own, decisions too: it waits up to 10 s for the engine's log to hold the
# decisions the proxy has already taken (a log read lags the event by well under
# a second; 10 is room, a missing line after it is a real absence), and 3128, the
# proxy's port, is core/egress.py's, never read here.
#
# Lives in gates/, so ci/contract.sh cold-runs it inside `make ci` with no
# CONFORMANCE set and no engine: the guard below must be the first thing
# that runs. `make harness-conformance` is the only caller that sets
# CONFORMANCE=1; the acceptance command is `./go harness-conformance

# undefined dependency (`required: false` included; checked 2026-11-04). So
# `make harness-conformance` merges the smallest workload fragment that
# defines `backend` and names no harness service, with WORKLOAD and
# WORKLOAD_CONTRACT for interpolation. That is the Makefile's to say (this
# directory never names a workload, ci/app-free.sh). What this gate owns is
