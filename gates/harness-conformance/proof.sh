# harness-conformance-proof: gates/harness-conformance.sh can fail
# (CLAUDE.md: a gate that cannot fail is not a gate), and it can pass,
# without an engine, a key or a real CLI. The suite is run, whole, on a copy
# of the tree that holds one made-up CLI harness, `fake-cli`, and a
# `docker-compose` that is a shell function in disguise:
#   - fake-cli is a pure adapter: a run.sh that honours the contract of
#     docs/adr/0041 (the refusal of another provider, the artefacts, the
#     stop lines, MODEL_BASE_URL) around a ~100-line client that speaks
#     Anthropic Messages to the scripted model and calls the guard before
#     every tool, as Claude Code's PreToolUse hook does. No container.
#   - the stand-in `docker-compose` answers the six calls the suite makes:
#     `config`, `build`, `up -d conformance-model` (starts stub.py on a local
#     port), `rm -sf conformance-model` (stops it), `logs` and `run` (refused:
#     fake-cli never uses it, so a run.sh that calls it is a run.sh that
#     started a container).
# The good fake must reach GO. Each defect below is one way a real harness can
# be wrong; the suite must refuse it, with a NO-GO naming the case it
# belongs to. So the proof is also a record of what each case catches.
#
# Confinement (docs/adr/0046) is proved the same way, with stand-ins for what
# an engine would give: the stand-in `docker-compose` starts the real
# core/egress.py (through egress_wrap.py, which gives it names and a source
# address of its own, 127.0.0.2, the one the stub then sees) and answers `exec`
# in the stub's container; and fake-cli, with the probe it runs, executes under
# a sitecustomize that plays the harness container's network: the proxy is
# reachable, every other address is not, and `egress` is the only name that
# resolves. A defect is a hole in that stand-in network or in the proxy's
# list. The probe is also proved channel by channel on its own, before the
# suite runs: each of its eight ways is opened alone and must be the one that
# reads `open`.
#
# Case 10, agents (docs/adr/0073), is proved on the real core/agents.py: the
# tree holds a contract, `c/` (WORKLOAD_CONTRACT=c), with an mcp.json and a
# stand-in for the fixture server, notes.py, that speaks newline JSON-RPC
# and answers search_notes and count_notes as the fixture does (the real one
# lives with a workload, which nothing under gates/ names: ci/app-free.sh).
# fake-cli honours mcp.json the way docs/adr/0073 §8-§9 asks: an mcp.sh that
# writes its configuration and the allow file, the servers started in the
# workspace, every tool of a declared server visible and the unnamed ones
# denied by its guard (`visible-denied`), a server that did not come up a
# one-line failure naming it and §8, run.json's .mcp from `agents.py calls`
# over hooks.log. A second good run takes fake-cli's mcp.sh away, with an
# adapter that is no CLI harness keeping one (replay's shape), so 10r, §8's
# refusal, is proved too; its defects are planted in agents.py's mcp verb,
# the one thing 10r judges. The contract sits at the tree's top so that a
# server started in fake-cli's own directory, not the workspace, still
# starts, and answers from the wrong place.
#
# The stand-ins listen on local ports the proof picks, and one picker serves
# them all: it is proved first, under the load the proxy's own sockets put on
# the kernel's port allocator, to hand out only ports its listeners can bind
# (a picker that asked on 127.0.0.1 failed one podman run in twenty, the
# stub's 60 s wait, and two docker ones, the proxy's).
#
# Run by `make harness-conformance` before the suite judges any real harness
# (the judge is judged first, as ci/prompts.sh proves its checker on planted
# files before reading roles/). Not a ci/ check: it starts the stub and
# fake-cli about thirty times, two and a half minutes of `./go ci` that
# ci/contract.sh would spend twice, and it needs the suite's own files, not
# the repository's.
#
# It is not a conformance run of any real harness and says nothing of one:
# fake-cli proves the suite, never an adapter. What it cannot prove without an
# engine: the internal network itself (the stand-in says what it blocks; only
# docker or podman route, or do not), DNS (the stand-in answers `egress` and
# nothing else, which is what a real internal network is meant to do and the
# thing that CVE-2024-29018 broke), the container's real peer address (127.0.0.2
# stands in for egress's, and a made-up `exec` for resolving it from the stub's
# side), a real CLI honouring HTTP_PROXY and NO_PROXY, and the container side of
# run.sh. Those are case 9 on docker in GitHub Actions and, once, on rootless
# podman. Nor the stub against the real CLIs' wire (the L0 suite of ADR 0041
# does, once a harness exists).
