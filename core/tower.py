"""The control plane's state machine (docs/adr/0019 §1, §2): stdlib only.

Vendor-free: it only calls the STATE_STORE and EVENT_BUS adapter verbs the
profile names, and the step scripts under $TOWER_STEPS. core/tower.sh is
its entry point (docs/adr/0052 §3); callers keep calling that.

    python3 core/tower.py open <ticket>          write the document at `opened`, publish `assign`
    python3 core/tower.py request <ticket>       write the document at `requested`, publish `clarify`
    python3 core/tower.py answer <ticket>        record ANSWER on the open question, publish `answer`
                                                 (`intake-answer` for an intake, docs/adr/0090 §2)
    python3 core/tower.py intake <id>            write the intake at `intake`, publish `interview` (docs/adr/0090 §1)
    python3 core/tower.py intake-confirm <id>    apply DECISIONS to a `proposed` intake: the kept tickets
                                                 at `spec-ready`, `spec` published for each (docs/adr/0090 §5)
    python3 core/tower.py step <ticket> <step>   apply one step: precondition, effect, write, publish next
    python3 core/tower.py resume <ticket>        request again the step whose last attempt failed
    python3 core/tower.py task [--patch] <run.json>  print the task fields a role's run leaves in the document,
                                                 with --patch also the patch beside it (docs/adr/0071 §1)

The document is plain JSON, one per ticket, id = ticket id. A step's
precondition is the state it starts from; an event whose precondition is
not the document's current state is dropped with one stderr line and exit
0 -- the idempotency rule, covering a duplicate event and a redelivery
after a slow step. A step script gets the document on $DOC_FILE (plus
TICKET, PR_NUMBER, BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA) and prints a JSON object on stdout:
at least {"state": "<next>"}, plus the fields it recorded, deep-merged
into the document. A step that exits non-zero, prints no state, or whose
next event cannot be published leaves the state and every other field as
they were, appends one history entry {step, state, at, error: <why>}, and
exits 1: no retries, no timeouts of the tower's own (docs/adr/0034 §1).
`resume` requires that entry to be the last one and appends {step:
"resume", resumed: <step>} before publishing the step again (docs/adr/0034
§2). Every history entry carries the document's `attempt` once it has one
(docs/adr/0038 §9). All output is on stderr, one `[tower]` line each.

Before `opened` (docs/adr/0055 §1, §2): `request` starts a ticket at
`requested`, with who requested and through what (REQUEST_BY, default
`unauthenticated`; REQUEST_VIA, default `cli`; docs/adr/0059 §4); `questions` waits for a person, and `answer` writes the
person's ANSWER (ANSWER_BY, default `unauthenticated`; ANSWER_VIA, default
`cli`) on the last question, which must be unanswered, then requests the
`answer` step. A step result that carries `task` is also appended, with
the document's attempt, to `tasks` (§5): every attempt's run is kept.

Before `requested` (docs/adr/0090): `intake` starts an intake document,
`kind: "intake"`, from TICKETS_DIR/<id>.intake.md, with INTAKE_BY and
INTAKE_VIA; `intake-questions` and `proposed` wait for a person;
`intake-confirm` writes each ticket the person keeps (DECISIONS,
CONFIRM_BY, CONFIRM_VIA) at `spec-ready` and the intake at `confirmed`.
Every step gets STEP_WHY, a file: a failing step that wrote a line there
is recorded `step exited <n>: <line>` (§6).

Spend (docs/adr/0083): every run a step's result carries (`task`,
`review`, `product`) is appended to `spend` with its cost from
profiles/prices.json. Before `assign` and `rework` the spend is checked
against policy/rework.env's SPEND_BUDGET_TICKET_USD and
SPEND_BUDGET_DAY_USD: over a limit, `assign` is refused like a red main
and `rework` runs with SPEND_STOP=<the line>, which ends the ticket at
`needs-human`. When `assign` or `rework` fails, the run the crew left in
.crew/<ticket>/out/run.json during the step is appended too, with `failed`
the budget marker in out/stop (docs/adr/0087 §1): a run stopped on its
TOKEN_BUDGET spent money the limits must count.
