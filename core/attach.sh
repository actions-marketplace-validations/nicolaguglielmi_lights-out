# core-attach (docs/adr/0037 §1): clones a repository of the user's into
# <dest>, the directory the Makefile then selects as the workload. Runs on
# the host under `./go attach`, with git and sh only, and inside workbench
# under demo-seam. The source is only read: every worktree and fetch the
# platform makes happens in the clone. A repository without
# .lights-out/workload.env committed at HEAD is attached too, for ./go
# init to draft one in the clone (docs/adr/0042 §6): the contract is read
# from there and nowhere else, so until then there is none. Not a gate:
# one stderr line and exit 1 on failure, one stderr line on success.
