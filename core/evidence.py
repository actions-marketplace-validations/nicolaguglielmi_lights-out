"""The evidence pack per release (docs/adr/0081): stdlib only.

Reads the release log and the ticket's document in the tower, never
writes them, and builds one JSON file in which every leaf is an entry:
{"source": S, "value": V} for evidence found where S says, or
{"source": S, "missing": W} for evidence looked for at S and not found,
W saying why. Nothing absent is filled in. core/evidence.sh signs the
file with cosign and verifies it; this file only builds it.

    VERSION=<v> STATE_STORE=<adapter> python3 core/evidence.py build
        write EVIDENCE_DIR/<v>.json (default .crew/evidence) from
        RELEASES_LOG (default .crew/releases.jsonl); print
        `<path>\\t<number missing>` on stdout and each missing path on
        stderr, exit 0; or print the one-line reason and exit 1
