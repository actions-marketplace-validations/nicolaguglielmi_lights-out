# core-mutation-baseline: `make mutation-baseline` (docs/adr/0015 §3,
# 0042 §6): the workload's MUTATION_CMD once over its whole scope
# (MUTATION_LINES=all), where its TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE says, for
# MUTATION_BASELINE's provenance. Prints the runner's one JSON line on
# stdout and a one-line summary (killed/total, score, seconds, where) on
# stderr; exits 1, nothing measured, when the run fails or the line does
# not carry total, killed and a numeric score. core/init.sh calls this
# and writes the score into the draft. Not a gate: no contract line.
