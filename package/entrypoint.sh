#   gates STAGED=1           ... with what /repo has staged as one more commit, judged alone
#   test-proof [BASE= HEAD=]     the gates test and test-proof only: the tests a change adds fail on its base
#   test-integrity [BASE= HEAD=] the gates test-weakening and mutation only: no test weakened, the changed lines' mutants killed
