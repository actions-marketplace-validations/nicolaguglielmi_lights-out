# the readiness pollers and the rest of the per-adapter scripts under
# adapters/*/, the release controller under core/, any script under gates/,
# verify/ or e2e/ once those exist, the stacks' gate runners that ./go init
# copies (stacks/*/runners/*.sh, docs/adr/0042 §6), and every workload's
# own scripts (app/, workloads/*/, docs/adr/0030 §5): smoke.sh, load.sh,
# the optional crew-prepare.sh, each in-image runner (tests/mutation/run.sh,
# tests/sast/run.sh) found by suffix, not by a fixed depth — a workload
# with no backend/-style subdirectory places them one level shallower than
# app/'s do — and the runners under its contract's runners/.
