# ci-workloads: replaces ci/compose.sh (docs/adr/0030 §5). Every workload
# directory in the repo -- today's app/, tomorrow's workloads/minimal/,
# found by the two globs docs/adr/0030 §5 names, */workload.env and
# workloads/*/workload.env -- is checked against the Workload port
# (docs/adr/0030 §2-3), independent of whichever WORKLOAD the enclosing
# `make` invocation itself selected:
#   (a) workload.env defines exactly the twelve keys, no more, no fewer --
#       an extra one could silently override DELIVERY or a `?=` default
#       (docs/adr/0030 §4's trap); WORKLOAD_TEST_PATHS, the globs naming
#       the tests (docs/adr/0053 §1), is non-empty; the four runner keys (docs/adr/0042
#       §1-§2) are non-empty commands with no `$` or `#` (make's include
#       would expand the one and cut at the other) and a TOOLCHAIN_IMAGE
#       of a known form: workbench, compose:<service>, an image reference;
#   (b) when the contract has a compose.yaml -- the plane half, required
#       only to run the plane (docs/adr/0042 §7) -- `docker-compose
#       config`, with that compose.yaml merged in explicitly (-f, not the
#       ambient COMPOSE_FILE, which reflects only the enclosing make's own
#       WORKLOAD) and WORKLOAD set for interpolation, shows the three fixed
#       services with their profiles and images (docs/adr/0030 §3), and a
#       compose: toolchain names one of them with profile test; a contract
#       without compose.yaml may not use the compose form;
#   (c) with the plane half, that workload's flags/flags.json defines
#       release-freeze and its own WORKLOAD_KILL_SWITCH;
#   (d) its worker.md, the dev-worker's brief, has `## Scope` and
#       `## Tests` (docs/adr/0037 §6);
#   (e) its policy.env, if any, passes core/policy.py: known keys, valid
#       values, a provenance line over each (docs/adr/0037 §5);
#   (f) with the plane half, the harnesses are confined (docs/adr/0046): on
#       the merged project rendered with the `crew` profile, network `crew`
#       is internal; every CLI harness service is on exactly [crew], with
#       the four proxy variables (HTTPS_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY and their lower-case
#       twins) at http://egress:3128, dns [192.0.2.1] and no published port;
#       every service a harness depends on (a workload's crew-postgres) is on
#       exactly [crew] with dns [192.0.2.1] and no published port (§7: the
#       engine's resolver forwards no name out); `egress` is on exactly crew
#       and default with
#       none. The first project rendered is also judged with one planted
#       defect at a time, and each must be named: a check that cannot fail
#       is not one;
#   (g) its crew-egress.txt, if it has one (the package indexes the worker may
#       reach, docs/adr/0046 §5), lists name:port entries in the shape an
#       adapter's EGRESS has (egress_flaw, ci/lib.sh), comment lines aside;
#       the shape is planted-defect checked here too.
# The contract is the workload's directory for one inside this checkout
# (app/), and its .lights-out/ for a repository laid out to be attached:
# workloads/*/ here, or the attached clone itself, named as the one
# argument by `make attached`, which exports its WORKLOAD_CONTRACT
# (docs/adr/0037 §2, §7).
# `docker-compose config` only renders the merged project; it needs no
# engine socket (ci/compose.sh's own rationale, docs/adr/0012), only the
# WORKBENCH_IMAGE precondition every other compose call in this repo has
# (the root compose.yaml's gemini-cli and runner services require it, :?).
