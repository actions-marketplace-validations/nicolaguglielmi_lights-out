# ci-logbook: the logbook and the console tell the truth and stay inside
# their perimeter (docs/adr/0047 §2-§5, Consequences; field by field in
# docs/plans/console.md, "Decided at build"), cold: no plane, no socket.
# Needs python3, jq, curl, git and the `jsonschema` package, all in the
# workbench. Written from that ADR and that plan, not from core/logbook.py
# or console/.
#   a. With stub sources in a throwaway root, core/logbook.sh runs twice:
#      one GO line each, the two files byte-equal, and byte-equal to the
#      golden fixtures/logbook/golden-1.6.json, written by hand from the
#      plan at 1.0, its 1.1 rows checked one by one against ADR 0055 §6 and
#      its 1.2 `adrs` against the stub map (docs/adr/0059 §3), its 1.3
#      `agents` against the stub contract (docs/adr/0073 §10), its 1.4 `why`
#      (docs/adr/0078 §2, §3) against the stub's tower documents (below), and
#      its 1.3 fields of ticket 0010, the network ticket, one by one against the
#      stub's tower documents and ADR 0071 (docs/adr/0071 §8): each task's
#      members (ids, harness, model, hand-written), files with their added
#      and removed counts, the patch shown, ci.gates (eight GO in the
#      Makefile's order), rework[0].gates (six GO, then mutation NO-GO), no
#      raw `lines`, the patch of 0004's attempt in flight withheld with the
#      contract's error, and tickets[].files rows (glob, member, attempts,
#      tests, adrs, held_by), each hand check run again on a logbook with
#      one fact planted wrong, which it must refuse. The 1.4 `why`, by hand
#      from ADR 0078 and the stub: ticket 0003's ci.why (attempt 2, gates, the
#      test gate, its line verbatim, its two FAILED lines, sast null) and its
#      rework[0].why (attempt 1, the sast gate, details shown, the two new
#      findings {rule, file, line}); ticket 0002's rework[0].why, recorded with
#      no gate lines, withheld with the exact error and its 1.3 `details`
#      null; ticket 0010's rework[0].why shown (mutation); every ci that said
#      GO has ci.why null; each run again on a logbook with one fact planted
#      wrong. The 1.5 `spend` and `dora` (docs/adr/0083 and 0082, amendments
#      of 2026-11-13), by hand from the stub: the ledger of 0003 and 0010 per
#      ticket, role and day, the summary, the limits and the budget line;
#      0007's stop the cap and, with a budget line in its document, the budget
#      and that line; the window ending at the record's last event and the
#      four measures; each run again with one fact planted wrong.
#      The 1.6 flow (docs/adr/0085 §1-§3), by hand from the stub: 0010's
#      fourteen nodes from the open to 100%, 0003's gates stopping at test,
#      each gate's seconds on ci and rework; the role matrix (docs/adr/0086),
#      0003's attempt in flight and the burn of 2026-11-03 (docs/adr/0087); each
#      run again planted wrong.
#      golden-1.5.json, golden-1.4.json, golden-1.3.json and golden-1.2.json stay in the
#      repository, untouched, as the old-logbook fixtures, and validate against
#      their schemas. The stub root
#      holds three ADRs, the files they cite, the notifier and its test, and
#      a ticket that names one in its one commit; its map is built from that
#      commit with core/map.py,
#      and the logbook's `adrs` and each ticket's `adrs` are worked out
#      again here from the map's rows with sqlite3 and fnmatch, not by
#      calling the reader's functions. Then variants of the sources, each
#      checked on the one field the plan's rule decides: no map, a map of
#      schema 1, a map at another commit, a map with no ADR, a map opened
#      read-only, a wide glob, who requested.
#      With no map, the files' tests and adrs are null; with the perimeters
#      held unread, their held_by is null (docs/adr/0071 §1).
#      The kanban's every card sits in its ticket's state's column, and moves
#      when the tower moves the ticket (docs/adr/0055 §7).
#   b. The golden validates against every committed schema of its major
#      (1.0 to 1.6), and against the schema file of its own minor; so do the
#      old fixtures, golden-1.5.json, golden-1.4.json, golden-1.3.json and golden-1.2.json (their own minors
#      and the ones before).
#   c. The committed snapshot, when there is one, validates, and its
#      spec.sha256 values are the committed tickets' (§4). A README with no
#      snapshot is drift; with neither, this point is skipped.
#   d. console/ names no adapter, no .crew/ and no store; serve.py starts
#      `core/logbook.sh`, `core/promote.sh`, `gates/spec.sh`,
#      `core/spec.py draft` and `make answer` / `make request` only, and has
#      four POST routes (docs/adr/0055 §2, docs/adr/0059 §4); index.html
#      fetches /v1/ only, POSTs to those four routes; `draggable` and the drag or drop handlers
#      appear only in the launch code, and a `draggable` value is conditional,
#      so only the held release's card drags (docs/adr/0079 §3, §5, which
#      amends docs/adr/0059 §1 for that one gesture). The
#      page's `#network-words` is `python3 core/network.py --table` as JSON,
#      its roles are the directories of roles/ and its gates the Makefile's
#      `GATES :=` (docs/adr/0071 §5), a wrong copy refused; and `make network
#      NETWORK_LOGBOOK=<golden>` prints on stdout what core/network.py prints
#      over the golden, for the default view and for TICKET and ATTEMPT.
#   e. The console at runtime: snapshot mode refuses to write and answers the
#      spec check without writing; the ETag answers 304; the start-up
#      refusals (§5); LIVE mode in the stub root refuses every bad press
#      before anything runs, and one good press moves the plane and records
#      who pressed; an answer to anything but the open question runs
#      nothing, and the good one runs `make answer` as `./go answer` does,
#      with who answered and `via: console` (docs/adr/0055 §2); the spec
#      check gives the line gates/spec.sh gives on the same file, on a GO
#      draft and on a NO-GO one per rule of ADR 0055 §4, and leaves the root
#      as it was; a request is refused in snapshot, public and without the
#      proxy header, refuses a NO-GO draft with nothing written, and on a GO
#      draft writes the next id and runs `make request` with who pressed and
#      `via: console` (docs/adr/0059 §4). The press's reason (docs/adr/0079
#      §2): a NO-GO with no reason, a blank one or a reason that is not a
#      string is refused with 400 before anything runs; a NO-GO with a reason
#      runs promote and the record's `rejected.reason` is it, via console; a
#      GO with a reason records it in `promoted.reason`, and both carry the
#      brief's sha256 (docs/adr/0079 §1).
#      The 1.4 canary fields (docs/adr/0080 §1-§4), by hand from the stub's
#      first log line and release.json: 0.2.0-a's reason and stage times and
#      slo, the others' none, launch.record's times, slo, reason and no running,
#      ticket 0001's canary row at the stage's judged_at with its slo, the rows
#      of the older releases at the release's at with none; a record in
#      progress surfaces `running` verbatim in launch.record; each check run
#      again on a logbook with one fact planted wrong.
#   f. Every numeric policy key has a "# Provenance, <kind>:" line above it
#      (Consequences).
# Before any of that, every checker runs on a bad input and must reject it:
# a gate that cannot fail is not a gate.
