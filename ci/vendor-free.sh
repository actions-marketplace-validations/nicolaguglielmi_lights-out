# ci-vendor-free: core/ never names a Delivery vendor (docs/adr/0024 §1).
# Adding a Delivery adapter is a directory under adapters/ and a DELIVERY=
# line in a profile, zero edits to core/; the proof is that no file under
# core/ contains the name of an adapter that exists or is planned, in code
# or in comments — a comment saying "no Envoy here" is a coupling too, the
# day Envoy goes it turns false. The word list is the Delivery column of
# plan §4 plus the third candidate of plan §11, grown to cover Flags too
# now that core/launchpad.sh reads the freeze flag through adapters/$FLAGS/
# evaluate.sh instead of a hardcoded flagd URL (docs/adr/0026 §3): extend
# it when the table grows, never shrink it.
