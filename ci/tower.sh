# ci-tower: proves core/tower.sh, adapters/inproc/run.sh and core/audit.sh
# (docs/adr/0019 §1, §2, §6, §9; docs/adr/0034; docs/adr/0038) on stub
# adapters, cold: no plane, no engine, milliseconds. The ci/harness.sh
# shape. A temp root holds file-backed stubs for the StateStore, EventBus
# and CodeHost ports plus a TOWER_STEPS directory of stub steps — except
# `merge`, which is the real core/steps/merge.sh over the stub CodeHost,
# because the crash case (§9 d) is about that seam, and `rework`, the real
# core/steps/rework.sh with the real policy/rework.env, because the rework
# loop and its cap (docs/adr/0038 §2, §3) are what cases (i) to (l) prove.
# The root's core/ is linked file by file so that core/crew.sh, the one
# thing rework.sh calls that needs a harness, can be a stub. Case (h) runs
# the real core/steps/ci.sh on a real git range: a PR is judged by the
# base's gates, policy and perimeter, not by its own (docs/adr/0033).
# The 1.3 sources (docs/adr/0071 §1, §8): the stub ci and crew leave what the
# real ones leave, the lines of each gate and the patch of an attempt, and the
# real rework.sh must copy the lines of the rejected attempt into its entry,
# whichever judge rejected it (gates (i), review (j), main (m)), and leave
# `lines` null where ci had none; case (h) runs the real ci.sh on a real range
# with two planted gates, one that always says GO and one that always says
# NO-GO, and `ci.lines` must be the gates' lines file, in order, stopping at the
# first NO-GO, and a perimeter NO-GO its one line. assign.sh and rework.sh ask
# tower.py for the patch, review.sh does not (static check, with its own
# planted miss). Each new check is able to fail: a premise names what would
# make it pass for the wrong reason.

# (h) docs/adr/0033, ticket 0007: the real core/steps/ci.sh on a real git
# range, a stub CodeHost and a stub Tracker. The base is this checkout's
# own judges, with GATES narrowed to risk (the one gate that routes; the
# other five need an engine or the network). The PR only loosens
# policy/merge.env so that every level auto-merges.
#   h1: the ticket's perimeter holds the diff. The PR's own policy would
#       auto-merge it; the CI step must classify it high (platform) with the
#       base's policy and send it to review.
#   h2: the same diff under a ticket whose perimeter does not hold it:
#       ci-failed, NO-GO on the perimeter, no gate run, whoever wrote it.
