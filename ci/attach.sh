# ci-attach: proves docs/adr/0037 cold (§7): no engine, no network, a few
# local git repositories and make probes. workloads/minimal, an attachable
# repository, is committed as "the user's repository" with decoys at its
# root that would pass for a contract, and attached by the real
# core/attach.sh into a temp ATTACHED, never this checkout's .attached/.
#   (a) only .lights-out/ is read (§1, §2): make takes the clone's contract
#       and nothing at its root; without .lights-out/workload.env make stops
#       naming it; attach refuses a repository without it committed at HEAD.
#   (b) an attached PR is judged by its base's policy.env (§4): the real
#       core/steps/ci.sh on a PR that drops its base's auth path.
#   (c) .lights-out/* never auto-merges (§5), even under the loosest policy
#       a workload may set; a policy.env that lets high merge fails CI.
#   (d) a bad policy.env is a NO-GO of gates/risk.sh naming the key (§5).
#   (e) at L0 the crew refuses an attached repository first thing (§8).
# Written from the ADR, not from the scripts; ci/tower.sh case (h)'s shape.
