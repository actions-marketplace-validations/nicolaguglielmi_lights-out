# ci-metrics: proves the Metrics port's promql adapter, the prometheus
# adapter that now wraps it, and verify/slo.sh running through it
# (docs/adr/0044 §8, §9), cold: no plane, no engine, no network beyond
# 127.0.0.1. An inline python3 HTTP server on 127.0.0.1, ephemeral port,
# stands in for a Prometheus-compatible endpoint: it records every request's
# method, path, raw query string, parsed query and headers, and answers from
# a control file the case rewrites (the bytes of a fixed body, a status, a
# delay, or a vector per query of verify/slo.promql). A curl shim first on
# PATH records curl's argv, then runs the real curl (or, for one case,
# refuses), so "not in argv" and "no network call" are observed, not assumed.
# Written from docs/adr/0044 §8 and §9, and (existing code, read for its
# thresholds and its output) verify/slo.sh, verify/slo.promql and
# policy/merge.env; not from adapters/promql/query.sh.
#
# Assumptions where the ADR leaves a detail open:
#   - The metrics cases run from the repository root, with a scrubbed
#     environment (env -i): every variable an adapter reads is set below.
#   - "Passthrough" means byte-for-byte, no added trailing newline.
#   - A server answer with an HTTP error status makes the adapter fail (it is
#     `curl -f`); stdout stays empty.
#   - METRICS_URL is a base: a path prefix on it keeps its place before
#     /api/v1/query. A trailing slash is not tested.
#   - A remote slower than the ADR's 3 s is a failure within 5 s, observed
#     with one deliberately slow answer (the only case that waits).
#   - docs/adr/0063 §3: a query that fails is `NO-GO: slo — cannot judge:
#     <query>: <cause>`; the cases glob on the words the ADR spells out
#     (`<metrics-query path> exited 22: `, `answer is not JSON`, `status
#     error: execution: <error>`) and leave the rest of the cause open. The
#     metrics-query path is the default for METRICS=promql,
#     adapters/promql/query.sh. A canned body is served for the failing
#     query only; the other queries answer from the vectors.
#   - docs/adr/0063 §2: verify/metric-shape.sh is run from a scratch root
#     holding copies of ci/lib.sh, verify/metric-shape.sh and verify/slo.promql,
#     against this same server (mode "fixed" answers every path with the
#     body): a /metrics scrape with no job/instance labels, as Prometheus
#     stamps them at scrape time.
#   - verify/slo.sh runs against a throwaway contract (an empty workload.env,
#     no policy.env), so the thresholds are policy/merge.env's defaults and
#     no workload's override can move the cases. The good canary equals the
#     stable one on every query, the bad ones differ by far more than any
#     threshold, so no threshold value is written down here.
