# ci-gates-light: proves docs/adr/0061 §9 cold, no engine, no network.
#   (a) each app/fixtures/gates fixture of `make demo-gates`, applied with
#       `git am` in a throwaway worktree of HEAD (its base/ patches first,
#       their commit the base), is judged by the light
#       tier (`python3 -m core gates --light`) against the fixture's
#       committed `expect`: RISK_LEVEL and RISK_DECISION always equal; where
#       expect failed at a gate the light tier ran, the light tier fails at
#       that gate; otherwise the light tier fails only at a gate after
#       expect's FAILED in the Makefile's GATES order, or not at all (with
#       this fixture set: GO). test and test-proof do not run here (the
#       app's TEST_CMD needs the compose Postgres); core/tests/test_light.py
#       proves them on scratch repositories.
#   (b) the light tier on this checkout's last commit is the one line of §5,
#       never `GO: gates`, and takes under 10 s.
#   (c) pyproject.toml maps `lights_out` onto core/ (§1) and no core/*.py
#       imports itself as `core.x` (§2).
#   (d) the comparison and the scan are shown to fail on a planted wrong
#       expect, a planted `from core.x import y` and a planted wrong
#       pyproject, each through the same functions the real checks use.
