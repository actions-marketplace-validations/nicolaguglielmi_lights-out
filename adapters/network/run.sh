# harness-network: the `network` AgentHarness (docs/adr/0036). Fans one
# ticket out to the members its `## Network` section declares, each a run
# of the profile's own harness (AGENT_HARNESS: replay at L0, gemini-cli at
# L1) in its own clone of BASE, with an input document that holds the
# ticket, its part and its own `## Perimeter`. Members run in parallel and
# share nothing while they run. Then each is judged on its own — the
# member harness's exit code, core/harness-check.sh, core/perimeter.sh on
# its own document — and no path may be changed by two members. Only if
# every member passes are their commits applied to WORKSPACE in the
# declared order; a refusal integrates nothing. The artefacts are the
# port's usual ones (patch, pr.json, final.md, run.json with `members`),
# and from here crew and the tower govern the composite as one PR.
#
# A ticket without `## Network` goes to the member harness unchanged: a
# network of one is a single worker. Picked by core/crew.sh only when
# CREW_HARNESS=network. Adapter convention (docs/adr/0012 §6): not a
# gate, members' output on stderr, one stderr line and exit 1 on failure.
# No pathname expansion anywhere: globs here are patterns, not files.
