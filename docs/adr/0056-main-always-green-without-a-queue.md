# ADR 0056 — Main always green without a queue: no re-judge on disjoint perimeters, main checked after merge, bisect and revert

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2026-11-07
- Milestone: M30
- Amends ADR 0019 §1 (the transition table: `merged` requests `mainline`,
  `release` starts from `main-green`) and ADR 0038 §2, §4 (a rework the
  tower sends back from main starts from main's head). Consistent with
  ADR 0033 (main is judged by the last green main's judges), ADR 0034 (a
  refusal is a recorded failed attempt) and ADR 0043 (the code host is
  touched only through the CodeHost port's verbs).

## Context

`core/steps/merge.sh` merges the head CI judged on whatever main is at
merge time. With several tickets in flight main moves between a PR's
judgment and its merge, the merge commit is a tree no gate has seen, and
nothing checks main afterwards.

The usual answer is a merge queue: re-judge each PR on the current main,
one at a time. The owner decided against it on 2026-11-07: with tickets
in flight multiplying, a global lock is a funnel. Conflicts are prevented
upstream (ADR 0053, M27: open tickets never hold overlapping perimeters)
and cured downstream, by finding the merge that broke main and reverting
it: the canary's principle applied to main.

With ADR 0053's holds, two tickets the tower runs never touch the same
file. Main can still move under a judged PR's perimeter, by a merge the
tower did not make (a person's, another tool's: the norm on an attached
repository) or by a revert. And two disjoint diffs can still break main
together: one renames what the other starts calling.

## Decision

1. **Merge without re-judging when the perimeter is untouched.** Before
   the adapter's `merge.sh`, `core/steps/merge.sh` runs `python3
   core/mainline.py rejudge`. It fetches the code host's default branch
   and lists the first-parent commits after `pr.base_sha` (the base the
   PR was judged on), each with the paths it changed against its first
   parent (`--no-renames`): what each commit *touched*, so a change later
   reverted still counts. The perimeter is the ticket's `## Perimeter`
   from the Tracker, never from the PR, matched as `core/perimeter.sh`
   does (`fnmatch.fnmatchcase`, `*` crosses `/`).
   - Nothing touched the perimeter: the adapter merges onto the moved
     main and no gate runs again; the main check (§3) judges the result.
     Main can still move between this read and the merge: the main check
     covers that too.
   - A commit touched it: no merge. The step prints `ci-failed` and
     `mainline: {verdict: "NO-GO", judge: "base", head_sha, line,
     details}`, line `NO-GO: base — main moved under the perimeter since
     <base>: <path> by <commit>`, one `details` entry per overlap. The
     ticket goes to rework (§6).
   - `pr.base_sha` is not on main (main was rewritten): the step fails
     and nothing is merged.
   - The head CI judged is already on main: a retry after the code host
     merged (ADR 0019 §9). Its own merge is not main moving under it; the
     adapter's idempotent merge answers.

2. **The table.**

   ```
    precondition()                  next()
   +  mainline) 'merged'          -  merged)     'release'
   -  release)  'merged'          +  merged)     'mainline'
   +  release)  'main-green'      +  main-green) 'release'
   ```

   `mainline` may also print `ci-failed`, which requests `rework`. The
   board's copy of the table (ADR 0035) follows.

3. **Main is checked after each merge, in groups of at most four.** The
   `mainline` step (`core/steps/mainline.sh`, a thin entry point for
   `python3 core/mainline.py check`) keeps one document beside the
   tickets: collection `mainline`, id `main`, `{state: "green" | "red",
   green, head, line, reverted: [...], at}`.
   - **The last green main, G**, is the document's `green` while it is on
     main; otherwise (no document, or main rewritten, as the L0 replays
     do) the base the ticket's PR was judged on. That base was never
     judged itself: a red base makes the first merge after it the
     culprit. ADR 0053 §6 checks the base before the first ticket on an
     attached repository; the bundled app's base is this checkout.
   - **Groups.** The first-parent commits after G, oldest first, are
     taken at most `MAINLINE_GROUP_MAX` at a time and the newest of the
     group is judged against G; GO moves G to it, until G is main's head.
     `MAINLINE_GROUP_MAX=4` in `policy/mainline.env`, read from the
     tower's checkout. Provenance: the owner's decision of four
     dev-worker attempts a day (`roles/dev-worker/role.env`), sized
     against the Gemini free tier's 250 requests a day at `MAX_TURNS=60`,
     the source of `REWORK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (ADR 0038 §3): a group is at most
     one day of that throughput, and bisecting it costs at most
     ⌈log₂ 4⌉ = 2 gate runs. It does not bound merges from outside the
     tower or on other providers; it is a decision to revisit with them.
   - **What judges main.** `make gates GATES="sast test"` in a worktree at
     the commit, the judges restored from G as `core/steps/ci.sh` restores
     a PR's base's (ADR 0033 §1). PLAN M30 says "the workload's gates";
     this narrows it on purpose to the gates whose subject is the whole
     tree. The diff gates (risk, secrets, deps, mutation, ADR 0053's)
     already judged each PR's own diff, a merge of disjoint diffs does not
     change their subject, and the ticket-bound ones have no ticket on
     main.
   - **The same tree is the same verdict**, under the same judges:
     verdicts are memoized by (tree, G). G's own tree is GO; so is the
     tree of the head the ticket's CI passed when G is that PR's base. A
     merge onto an unmoved main has exactly that tree, so `./go demo`'s
     single ticket pays a fetch, not a gate run.
   - **What ships is the green main.** The ticket's document records
     `mainline.green`, the judged commit its merge is in, and
     `core/steps/release.sh` releases that commit. A merge inside a group
     is never judged alone, so its own tree is never released.

4. **Bisect, revert through the code host, rework the culprit.** A
   group's newest commit NO-GO writes the document `red` with the line,
   then bisects the group between G (green) and that commit (red): the
   first red commit is the culprit, in at most ⌈log₂ n⌉ more runs. It is
   reverted with the CodeHost port's existing verbs: a branch
   `revert/<sha>` from main's head with `git revert` (`-m 1` for a merge),
   `push.sh`, `open-pr.sh` with a title and the verdict as body,
   `merge.sh` at that head. A revert, never a force push: main keeps both
   commits, and an outside commit made meanwhile is not lost. Main's new
   head is judged; GO writes the document `green` and appends `{merge,
   revert, line, details, at}` to `reverted`, `line` and `details` being
   the culprit's own verdict.
   - **The ticket of the step.** Its merge in `reverted`: `ci-failed`,
     `mainline: {verdict: "NO-GO", judge: "main", head_sha, line,
     details}`, rework. Otherwise `main-green`. The culprit's ticket
     learns it from its own `mainline` step, queued after its merge; a
     culprit merged outside the tower is reverted and recorded with
     nobody to send it to. A ticket whose merge is not on main fails the
     step.
   - **One culprit per check.** The revert does not apply, the culprit is
     a revert or already reverted, or main is still NO-GO after the
     revert: the document stays `red` with the reason and the step fails
     (ADR 0034).

5. **A red main stops assign, rework and release, and is lifted by a
   fix.** Before `assign`, `rework` or `release`, `core/tower.py` reads
   `mainline/main`; `red` refuses the step before it runs, the state
   stays, and the failed attempt is recorded with the error `main is
   NO-GO since <G>: <line>`, so the reason is in the ticket's document as
   in main's. `rework` is refused too: an attempt started from a red main
   would be charged a failure it inherited (ADR 0053 §6's rule). While
   the document is red a `mainline` step judges main's head as it is and
   never bisects again: GO turns it green, NO-GO fails again. So a person
   fixes main, then `./go resume` requests the stranded steps (ADR 0034).
   The shape of `release-freeze` (ADR 0013 §6): a refusal before any
   effect, recorded, lifted by state.

6. **Rework on the new base.** `core/steps/rework.sh` reads `.mainline`
   before `.ci`: its `judge` (`base` or `main`) goes into the `.rework`
   entry, and the next attempt prints `mainline: null` beside `ci: null`.
   For these judges `core/crew.sh` starts attempt n + 1 from main's head
   (`REWORK_FRESH`), not from the rejected head: that head is under a
   revert or judged on a base that is gone. The worker gets the ticket,
   the brief and the verdict (ADR 0038 §4). A rework never resets main:
   at L0 `adapters/gitea/bootstrap.sh` force-pushes this checkout to main
   only for attempt 1 (`CODE_HOST_KEEP_MAIN` otherwise). The cap
   (ADR 0038 §3) counts these attempts: each spends a worker's quota like
   any other. At L0 an attempt 2 replays `fixtures/<ticket>/<role>/
   attempt-2/` or fails naming it (ADR 0038 §8). No integrator role.

7. **The proof.**
   - `core/tests/test_mainline.py` (`unittest`, from this ADR): the
     perimeter match, the overlap over touched paths, the group limit,
     the bisection's culprit and its number of runs.
   - `ci/mainline.sh` in `./go ci`, no engine: the real merge and
     `mainline` steps on a temp git repository behind a stub CodeHost,
     with a stub workload whose `gates` target is a script. Re-judge:
     base unmoved, merged; moved outside the perimeter, merged with no
     gate run; moved inside it, `ci-failed` and not merged; touched and
     since reverted, still `ci-failed`; base rewritten, the step fails.
     Main check: a green group; a red group bisected, its culprit
     reverted on the host, main green; a revert that does not apply
     leaves main red.
   - `core/tests/test_tower.py`: a red `mainline/main` refuses `assign`,
     `rework` and `release` with the reason, and no other step.
   - `./go demo-mainline`, L0, no key: tickets 0020–0022, hand-written
     fixtures (README, "What is real"). 0020 and 0021 hold disjoint
     perimeters; 0020 renames a function 0021 starts calling, and each
     passes its gates alone. 0022's perimeter is `app/backend/meetups/
     db.py`. After the three are judged, a change to `db.py` lands on main
     through the code host with no ticket: a person's merge. 0020 and
     0021 merge without re-judging; 0022 goes back to rework naming
     `db.py` and that commit; the main check finds main NO-GO, bisects to
     0021's merge, reverts it, and main is GO. The demo applies the bus's
     events itself, with `core/tower.sh step` as `adapters/inproc/run.sh`
     does, for two reasons it prints: the person's merge must land
     between judging and merging, and it stops where other demos take
     over (the release is `./go e2e`'s, an attempt 2 `./go
     demo-rework`'s), acknowledging those requested steps unapplied.

## Alternatives rejected

- **A merge queue with a global lock.** The owner's decision of
  2026-11-07: every PR waits for every gate run ahead of it, a wait that
  grows with the tickets in flight. Here a disjoint PR merges at once and
  main pays one gate run per group.
- **Speculative batches** (judge PR combinations in parallel, merge the
  largest green prefix). N runs at once is N times the engine at L0, on a
  laptop, paid mostly for nothing when perimeters are disjoint. The
  bisection pays only when main is red.
- **A version control of our own** (a patch algebra that merges without
  conflicts). Out of scope: the code host is a port (ADR 0043) and git is
  the contract every workload already has.
- **An integrator role** that rebases and fixes conflicting PRs. A
  seventh role; `ci/roles.sh` holds six. The conflict goes back to the
  `dev-worker` (ADR 0038).
- **Re-judge every PR whose base moved.** Correct, but every concurrent
  PR pays a second full gate run, mutation included, for an interaction
  disjoint perimeters make rare and the main check catches.
- **Block merges while main is unchecked.** The queue again.
- **Restore main by force-pushing the last green commit.** It rewrites
  history others fetched, loses outside commits made meanwhile, and a
  protected branch refuses it. A revert is a commit: audited, reversible.
- **Every gate on main.** Mutation repeats each PR's run on the sum of
  their lines; `test-weakening` reads a ticket's declared removals, and
  main has no ticket.
- **Each ticket's step judges only its own merge commit** (no groups).
  The release problem it solves is solved by releasing the green main
  (§3), and it bisects nothing: every red merge would be its own culprit
  only when no outside commit landed before it.

## Consequences

- Every merged ticket gains a `mainline` history entry before release;
  `demo-rework`'s trail gains it; `./go audit` reads `main-green` as
  merged and a reverted merge as why a merged PR is back at `ci-failed`.
- The replays (`e2e`, `demo-rework`, `demo-review`, `demo-mainline`)
  delete `mainline/main` with the ticket's document: a red main left by
  an earlier run on a live plane cannot refuse `./go demo`'s `assign`.
- At L0, attempt 1's bootstrap still resets main to this checkout. A
  ticket assigned after a merge in the same run (ADR 0053 §5's resume)
  resets main under the merged ones; their `mainline` step then fails on
  a merge that is not on main. Noted, not changed here.
- ADR 0053's holds end at `merged`; under this ADR a merged ticket can
  return to `ci-failed`. When both land, `merged` joins its holding
  states, so a hold lasts until `main-green`.
- Two culprits in one group need a person. At L2 two `mainline` steps at
  once would race on the document; the inproc orchestrator applies one
  event at a time.

## Golden-rule check

`./go demo` runs `e2e` on ticket 0001, merged onto an unmoved main: its
tree is the one CI passed, so the `mainline` step is GO after one fetch,
and the release ships the same commit as before. `./go demo-mainline` is
a separate target, not in the demo's fixed list (ADR 0003).
